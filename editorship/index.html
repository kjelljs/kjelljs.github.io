<p>Louise and I strive to sustain the successes achieved by the founding editors, David Beaver and Kai von Fintel, maintaining the exceptional standards set by them for the quality and timeliness of the editorial process.</p><hr>
	<p>Here is the <a href="http://kjelljs.github.io/pdf/Finteltweet.pdf"><b>tweet</b></a> of Kai's on the occasion of the transition of the role of editors in chief from him and David to Louise and me.</p><hr>
<p>When you submit a paper to us, one of the associate editors shown below, or Louise or I, signs on to shepherd it, soliciting reviewers, reading it carefully, and eventually – preferably within sixty days – writing a thorough and constructive letter of decision to you, informed by the reviews and approved by the whole editorial team.</p> <p>There are two key words here, <b>sixty</b> and <b>informed</b>. Sixty: It is our ambition that you should not have to wait for a decision for more than that number of days. Informed: It is likewise our policy to form a well-considered and comprehensive opinion of your submission and to communicate this opinion to you in a clear and helpful way.</p>

<p>In other words, we are hands-on and do not hide behind reviewers and publishers' officers; a letter like this will not be coming from us:
