<div class="ingress"><p>On June 11, 2009, Day I of the Arne Naess Memorial Seminar, I gave a commentary on the paper "Arne Naess and Empirical Semantics" given by Siobhan Chapman. Here is the text on which the commentary was based.</p></div>

<p>A great thanks to Dr. Chapman for a very insightful and enlightening
survey and assessment of that core part of Næss's philosophy, for decades
so central to his work and forever so close to his heart, which, in his
own words, in the forties got the label Empirical Semantics. What I feel
called upon to do is to supply some not actually critical but
supplementary comments from a slightly different angle, namely, the
perspective of a present-day semanticist in the logical tradition – formal
semantics, as it has developed since 1973, the year of publication of
  Richard Montague's most influential paper.</p>
<p>
The Empirical Semantics programme was in large part a critical programme,
opposed to major tenets and practices of contemporary mainstream,
especially Anglo-American, philosophy of language. I discern two main
strands of criticism: the first, the opposition to reducing language to a
system of rules, an ideological criticism, the second, the opposition to
introspection and intuition – a methodological criticism.
</p><p>
The first stance involved the insistence that language has, essentially, a
social dimension; the emphasis on variance and vagueness, and on variance
of precision, also called the definiteness of intention; the focus on
language in use, the conviction that language use is much more sloppy and
diverse than any set of rules could predict. Here, I believe it is clear
that time has proven Næss and Empirical Semantics right, specifically through the
emergence of novel subdisciplines of the study of linguistic meaning:
foremost, pragmatics and sociolinguistics; but also through the
large-scale incorporation of various aspects of context and discourse
sensitivity into more or less "pure" semantics since the late 1970ies.
</p><p>
The second stance involved the insistence that semantics should be
testable and tested, based on a deep distrust of intellectualist,
"armchair", introspective method. In this regard, it is much less clear
that the recommendations of Empirical Semantics have been taken to heart by semanticists.
To a considerable extent, we have disregarded them. My claim is that in so
doing, we have missed something, but, all things considered, not all too
much. So there is reason both for a guilty and for a clean conscience.
</p><p>
To justify the clean conscience first: There is consensus today that there
has been enormous progress made over the last forty years or so, that is,
after Empirical Semantics lost its momentum, in semantics, in two inextricably linked
dimensions: the descriptive and the theoretical. In part, this owes to the
emergence, since 1957, of a science of syntax; in part, it owes to the
emergence, since 1973, of a science of natural language semantics. (There
were important precursors, of course, contemporary with or prior to Empirical Semantics,
but coherent theories with real potential for growth were not yet in
place.)

<p>
Now the Empirical Semantics insistence on testability and actual testing was sweeping: it
compassed all semantic statements, including metastatements. Tarski's
(1936) notion of truth, so essential to model theoretic semantics, was a
major target of attack for Næss. But what is testable? Hypotheses can be
tested, hypotheses about, say, entailment relations or semantic
infelicities; descriptive generalisations, like: the word or is
interpreted in accordance with the truth table of propositional calculus
(Næss 1961). But theories are stricto sensu simply not amenable to
testing. For them, there are other success criteria, not least elegance. A
good analysis has a true ring to it to theorists, and this true tone is
remarkably interpersonal. The analysis may have consequences in the form
of predictions that were not thought of as it was developed, and so may
have to be revised if those predictions are not borne out, but it is
partly confirmed by a quality of explanation (which was not considered by
Empirical Semantics or more generally at the floruit of Empirical Semantics). In fact, the progress made
in semantic theory would not have been possible should the warnings of
Empirical Semantics have been fully heeded. It is probably fair to say that Empirical Semantics did not
envisage a theory of semantics with explanatory force. The scepticism to
anything semantic outside the realm of experiment would seem to leave no
room for it. A quote from Russell ("Vagueness", published 1923) may seem
curiously apt: "But the sceptical philosophy is so short as to be
uninteresting; therefore it is natural for a person who has learnt to
philosophise to work out other alternatives, even if there is no very good
ground for regarding them as preferable."
</p><p>
Still, in the descriptive dimension where Empirical Semantics was at home, there is also
ample reason for a guilty conscience among semanticists. On the one hand,
introspection, the semanticist’s own intuition, has remained a viable,
respectable, and fruitful method of establishing semantic facts on the
basis of data, and intersubjectivity among scholars secures a certain
reliability. In this way, a large body of semantic fact has been amassed.
On the other hand, this body rests on clay feet, as the selection of data
has remained erratic, impressionistic, and small-sampled. Indeed, most
examples are constructed. In fact, recent corpus-based studies have shown
some widely accepted generalisations to have been misguided by the limited
imagination of the generic semanticist. What is more, it has been shown
that in some areas, the set of data will be prone to be biased and the
facts to be flawed. Although occurrence analyses over large corpora are
now fully feasible, they have been slow to penetrate into formal
semantics. So there is reason to suspect that many alleged facts are in
actual fact of a mythical nature. In other words: Semantics is still far
from empirical enough.
