	<p>My presentation at the 10th instalment of the conference Philosophical Linguistics and Linguistical Philosophy – <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/phlip/phlip-10/">PhLiP 10</a> – on October 24, 2025, where I lament the lack of light on world-to-mind question-embedding predicates like <i>in two minds</i> and <i>make up one's mind</i>, and propose a theory of them: Alongside agents' <b>inquisitive state</b>, modeling the issues they believe may be the case, the theory posits their <b>deliberative state</b>, modeling the issues they believe they can bring about; then, alongside their <b>information state</b> – what they believe to in fact be the case – sits their <b>resolution state</b> – what they intend to in fact bring about.

Starting with her 1998 dissertation, she has pioneered the comparative method in discourse semantics, showing how pairing up one language with one or more others can offer invaluable clues to meaning distinctions that may otherwise escape notice and to the contextual cues that make us select an interpretation.
Particularly notable are the discoveries of the various modes of event unification that can be conveyed with non-finite structures in a language like English and the findings on coordination at different levels and on explicit markers of event linking in a language like Norwegian.
This highly original work has had a strong influence on scholars like Robyn Carston, Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen and myself, and in this talk, I will recount some highlights of it.</i></blockquote>

It is a simplification of Krifka's actual analysis of this case, where the argument of "assert" (or "tell") has type e(e(ss)), not just (ss), but where, still, "binding of the subject pronoun <i>he</i> to the speaker of the speech act x is assumed without specification of an explicit mechanism, for simplicity". It does not in fact seem straightforward to encode the Kaplanian substitution scheme (as rendered, e.g., on p. 282 in my "Reports of specific indefinites", JoS 30(3), 267–314) in this format. Thanks to Serge Minor for pointing this out.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="blogposts">&raquo; &nbsp;"Alone": A graduate course experiment</li><p>In autumn 2013, I taught an experimental graduate course in semantics at the University of Chicago: A realistic research rehearsal. The course description:
	<blockquote>
<i>I would like to try out an idea for a "collaborative case study effort" in semantic analysis. We will take some phenomenon which is not well understood (by anyone), explore it and delineate it, identify the problem(s), make descriptive generalizations, scan the literature, form hypotheses and test them, check out on crosslinguistic stability, cast about for appropriate theoretical tools and existing analyses of reminiscent phenomena, discern alternative approaches, consider how to divide labor between syntax, context, and pragmatics, weigh arguments according to theoretical standards, – with a view to come up with a jointly approved account, maybe even a joint paper. Maybe the best choice of phenomenon would be a word which turns out to have surprising properties, not shared by other members of its class. The concrete topic will be decided on at the start of the seminar.</i></blockquote>
The most tangible result (so far) is the handout for our presentation at the UChicago Linguistics Colloquium on December 5, 2013: <a href="/pdf/alone.pdf">Alone</a>.

<i>The two scenarios sketched for the sentence «There is milk in the fridge» by Travis (1989) suggest that the contribution of a noun like «milk» to the truth conditions of sentences containing it depends on the context, and, moreover, that this dependency can involve pragmatic reasoning. After considering three alternative ways to account for this intuition, I discuss the implications of assuming that the content of a noun does vary with the context and that the relevant aspects of the context can indeed include a conception of the interlocutors’ intentions and beliefs.</i></blockquote></p>
