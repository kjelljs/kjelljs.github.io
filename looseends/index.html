It is a simplification of Krifka's actual analysis of this case, where the argument of "assert" (or "tell") has type e(e(ss)), not just (ss), but where, still, "binding of the subject pronoun <i>he</i> to the speaker of the speech act x is assumed without specification of an explicit mechanism, for simplicity". It does not in fact seem straightforward to encode the Kaplanian substitution scheme (as rendered, e.g., on p. 282 in my "Reports of specific indefinites", JoS 30(3), 267–314) in this format. Thanks to Serge Minor for pointing this out.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="blogposts">&raquo; &nbsp;"Alone": A graduate course experiment</li><p>In autumn 2013, I taught an experimental graduate course in semantics at the University of Chicago: A realistic research rehearsal. The course description:</p>
	<p>
<i>I would like to try out an idea for a "collaborative case study effort" in semantic analysis. We will take some phenomenon which is not well understood (by anyone), explore it and delineate it, identify the problem(s), make descriptive generalizations, scan the literature, form hypotheses and test them, check out on crosslinguistic stability, cast about for appropriate theoretical tools and existing analyses of reminiscent phenomena, discern alternative approaches, consider how to divide labor between syntax, context, and pragmatics, weigh arguments according to theoretical standards, – with a view to come up with a jointly approved account, maybe even a joint paper. Maybe the best choice of phenomenon would be a word which turns out to have surprising properties, not shared by other members of its class. The concrete topic will be decided on at the start of the seminar.</i></p>
	<p>
The most tangible result (so far) is the handout for our presentation at the UChicago Linguistics Colloquium on December 5, 2013: <a href="/pdf/alone.pdf">Alone</a>.
