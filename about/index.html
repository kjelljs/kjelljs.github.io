	<h1>Kjell Johan Sæbø</h1>
	<div class="ingress"><p>I am a semanticist, trying to understand how meanings are made with human language, and to share what understanding I gain in an intelligible way.</p>
		<p>But I am something else as well.</p>
	<p>On this page, I recount what I am as an academic and otherwise and how this has come to be. There are two sections: <a href="#acad">Professional Paths</a> and <a href="#priv">Personal Paths</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="acad">Professional Paths</h2>
	<p>I started my university studies at the University of Oslo in 1974 and finished my Master's degree there in 1978. My subjects were English, German, and mathematics, and German was my major.</p><p>Why German? That had nothing to do with the language. It so happened that the Danish scholar Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen now taught German linguistics at the University of Oslo. She offered to supervise a Master's thesis project on some, any, topic in theoretical syntax or semantics. This would not have been possible in any other department at the time. I could not decline that.</p>

	<p>So in 1978 I wrote my Master's thesis in the novel field of Montague Grammar. Per-Kristian Halvorsen, who had just finished his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin, warned against the project, but Cathrine did not heed his warning.</p><p>I was an absolute novice to any school of formal linguistics. Cathrine gave me samples of generative syntax and generative semantics to read, but also texts on this new thing, and it shone through that this was the real thing. The result was <i>Tempus in einer Montague-Grammatik des Deutschen</i> 'Tense in a Montague Grammar of German'.</p>

	<p>Montague Grammar was new to Cathrine too. She was introduced to it by Jens Erik Fenstad, professor of mathematical logic at the University of Oslo, who started a cross-disciplinary, cross-departmental seminar on natural language in 1976 together with psychology professor Ragnar Rommetveit and philosophy professor Dagfinn Føllesdal. In varying incarnations, that seminar has an unbroken history until this day.</p>

	<h2 id="priv">Personal Paths</h2>
	<p>I love hiking in forests and mountains. And while I treasure maps, I especially like to not know exactly where I am or am heading but go on.</p>
	<p>Her finner du en del om hvem jeg er.</p>
