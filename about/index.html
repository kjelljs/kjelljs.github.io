	<h1>Kjell Johan Sæbø</h1>
	<div class="ingress"><p>I am a semanticist, trying to understand how meanings are made with human language, and to share what understanding I gain in an intelligible way.</p>
		<p>But I am something else as well.</p>
	<p>On this page, I recount what I am as an academic and otherwise and how this has come to be. There are two sections: <a href="#acad">Professional Paths</a> and <a href="#priv">Personal Paths</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="acad">Professional Paths</h2>
	<p>I started my university studies at the University of Oslo in 1974 and finished my Master's degree there in 1978. My subjects were English, German, and mathematics, and German was my major.</p><p>Why German? That had nothing to do with the language as such or anything cultural. It so happened that the Danish scholar <b>Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen</b> now taught German linguistics at the University of Oslo. She offered to supervise a Master's thesis project on some, any, topic in theoretical syntax or semantics. This would not have been possible in any other department at the time. I could not decline that.</p>

	<p>I was an absolute novice to any school of formal linguistics. Cathrine gave me samples of generative syntax and generative semantics to read, but also texts on this new thing, and it shone through that this new thing was the real thing. So I wrote my Master's thesis in Montague Grammar: <i>Tempus in einer Montague-Grammatik des Deutschen</i>. Per-Kristian Halvorsen, who had just finished his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin, warned against the project, but Cathrine did not heed the warning.</p>

	<p>Montague Grammar was quite new to Cathrine too. She was introduced to it by <b>Jens Erik Fenstad</b>, professor of mathematical logic at the University of Oslo, who started a cross-departmental seminar series on natural language in 1976 together with philosophy professor Dagfinn Føllesdal and psychology professor Ragnar Rommetveit. Under varying names (<i>Seminar i lingvistikk</i>, <i>Seminar i datalingvistikk</i>, <i>Seminar i semantikk</i>, <i>Forum for teoretisk lingvistikk</i>), this series has an unbroken history up to the present day.</p>
<p>In summer 1980, Jens Erik organized a workshop over several days in Oslo and Telemark, <i>Models for Natural Languages</i>, where Hans Kamp presented early work on Discourse Representation Theory and Jon Barwise presented his joint work with Robin Cooper on generalized quantifiers and early work on Situation Semantics; other presenters included Emmon Bach, Barbara Partee and Stanley Peters.</p>
	<p>Cathrine encouraged me to propose a PhD project and apply for a grant to carry it out. In a late phase of this project, her friend <b>Arnim von Stechow</b> offered me a 9-month research position at the University of Constance, FRG. So in the early morning of Jan 3, 1984, I stepped off the train and found my way through winding alleys to his home at St. Stephansplatz and to his wife Franziska's studio in the same house, where I got a room.</p>
	<div style="float:right;"><figure class="rightfig"><img style="height:236px;" src="/pics/AvS65.jpg"><figcaption>Arnim von Stechow at age 65</figcaption></figure></div>
	<p>It goes without saying that the University of Constance provided a favorable environment for research in semantics. Also working on their dissertations were Manfred Krifka (who had a 6-month research position) and Ede Zimmermann. Wolfgang Sternefeld (who sublet a room to Manfred Krifka) had just finished his (I hand-wrote the minutes at his rigorosum). Rainer Bäuerle was there, Arnim himself a strong presence. When I left, my dissertation was all but finished; <i>Notwendige Bedingungen im Deutschen: zur Semantik modalisierter Sätze</i> was printed as no. 108 in the series <i>Papiere des SFB 99</i> in 1985. That is the <i>urtext</i> on what has come to be known as anankastic conditionals.</p>
<p>On January 3, 1987, I stepped off the train in Tübingen to take up work in the project <i>Linguistische und logische Methoden für das maschinelle Verstehen des Deutschen</i> 'Linguistic and logical methods for machine understanding of German', LILOG, sponsored and coordinated by IBM Germany in Stuttgart and involving consortia all over the Federal Republic. My boss here was <b>Franz Guenthner</b>, and Rainer Bäuerle was his deputy. Also in Tübingen were two other Constance companions, Manfred Krifka and Ede Zimmermann.</p>
<p>LILOG was an ambitious project, aiming at a question answering system that could answer any question based on any text that was fed to it. For the first prototype, the text was a hiker's guide to Alsace. (That is where Manfred Krifka's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00627291">Four thousand ships passed through the lock<a> example came from &ndash; see separate story under Miscellanea.)</p>
	<p>Over-ambitious. Managerial idealism rubbed against scholarly realism. Our group in Tübingen was an easy target: We were charged with the task of automating text coherence, providing algorithms for still understudied and ill-understood phenomena like anaphora of different sorts and types, ellipsis, and discourse particles. Yet it wasn't all frictions and frustrations: One ray of light was the fact that one of two LILOG papers accepted for the 1988 COLING conference cam from us.</p>
	<h2 id="priv">Personal Paths</h2>
	<p>I love hiking in forests and mountains. And while I treasure maps, I especially like to not know exactly where I am or am heading but go on.</p>
	<p>Her finner du en del om hvem jeg er.</p>
