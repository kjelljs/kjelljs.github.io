title: "Genesis of Krifka (1990)"

<div class="ingress"><p>One of Manfred Krifka's many milestone contributions to semantics is his 1990 L&P paper "Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events".</p></div><p>Many know that paradigm example of the 4000 ships passing through the lock, but few know its origin. In 1986, IBM Germany decided that a hiker's guide to Alsace was to serve as a testbed and benchmark for the project LILOG (<b>Linguistische und logische Methoden für das maschinelle Verstehen des Deutschen</b>). See this excerpt. Manfred Krifka was not in LILOG but in LEX but he was in the same house as the Tübingen leg of the project.</p>
