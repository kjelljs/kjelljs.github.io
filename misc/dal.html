  <p>On December 2, 2022, I was awarded the <a href="https://unifor.no/stiftelser/professor-ingerid-dal-og-soster-ulrikke-greve-dals-legat-til-stotte-av-humanistisk-forskning/">Professor Ingerid Dal and sister Ulrikke Greve Dal Foundation prize for research in comparative linguistics, theoretical mathematics and rationalist philosophy</a>. The slides for my acceptance address are behind the photo on the right.</p></div>
<p>
The address was a word of thanks and an explainer: an answer to how work of mine can fall under those statutes. The main chord struck: the "and" conjoining the three areas of linguistics, mathematics and philosophy, reasonably read as an "or", might just take on a literal sense when the field is formal semantics, at the cross-section of all three./p>
