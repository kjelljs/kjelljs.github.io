<div class="ingress"><p>The 12th annual conference of the Gesellschaft für Semantik (Society of Semantics), Sinn und Bedeutung (SuB) 12, was organized in Oslo, September 20–22, 2007.</p></div>
<p>
When Oslo was elected to host the conference, interest and expertise in formal semantics were scarce here, as throughout Scandinavia, and in consequence, practically sole responsibility for matters major and minor fell to a very few persons. Still, we managed to put on a fair show, and to put together a fine volume of proceedings, the first to only appear electronically. Below are links to the full book as well as to the front matter and the individual papers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
