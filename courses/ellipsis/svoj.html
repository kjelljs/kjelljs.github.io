title: "Russian <i>svoj-</i> and sloppy identity"

<div class="ingress"><p>According to <a href="https://www2.ling.su.se/staff/oesten/recycled/OnSo-calledSloppyIdentity.pdf">Dahl (1973: 106)</a>, in the 1st and 2nd persons the Russian possessive <i>svoj-</i> is incompatible with the 'strict' reading but in the 3rd person it is compatible with it.</p></div>

<p>Is this surprising or unsurprising in light of common claims about English <i>-self</i>, as rendered by, for instance, <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/elsj1984/14/0/14_0_70/_pdf">Terada (1997: 71)</a>?</p>
