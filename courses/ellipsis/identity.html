title: "Syntactic or semantic identity"
---

<div class="ingress"><p>Different kinds of ellipsis have different identity conditions (aka <i>isomorphism conditions</i>): Some are more syntactic while others are more semantic in nature.</p></div>

<p>Try to rank the five 'kinds' Nominal ellipsis, Gapping and Stripping, Sluicing, VP ellipsis and Null Complement Anaphora along the cline from syntactic to semantic, in a partial order!</p>

<p>Connect with the influential distinction between 'deep' and 'surface' anaphora made by Hankamer and Sag (1976) â€“ for relativizations, see Kehler (2019).</p>
