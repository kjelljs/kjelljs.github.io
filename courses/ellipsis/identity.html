title: "Syntactic or semantic identity"
---

<div class="ingress"><p>Different kinds of ellipsis have different identity conditions (aka <i>isomorphism conditions</i>): Some are more syntactic while others are more semantic in nature.</p></div><p>Roughly, this gradience corresponds to how plausible it is that the ellipsis is built in the syntax but is deleted at PF – or that it is just a piece of content encoded in a null proform (catchphrase <i>what you see is what you get</i>).</p>

<p>Try to rank the five 'kinds' • Nominal ellipsis, • Gapping and Stripping, • Sluicing, • VP ellipsis and • Null Complement Anaphora along the cline from syntactic to semantic, in a partial order!</p>

<p>Connect with the influential distinction between 'deep' and 'surface' anaphora made by Hankamer and Sag (1976) – for relativizations, see Kehler (2019).</p>
