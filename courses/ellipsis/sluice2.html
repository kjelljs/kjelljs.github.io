title: "Sluices on clausal disjunctions"

<style>
  ol {
  margin-left: 0;
  padding-left: 0;
}
ol li {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: .5em;
  margin-left: 2em;
}
ol li::before {
  display: inline-block;
  content: "(" counter(item) ") ";
  counter-increment: item;
  width: 2em;
  margin-left: -2em;
}
</style>

<div class="ingress"><p>Some sluices are hard to spell out.</p></div>
<p>In particular, this is the case for clausal disjunctive sluices â€“ sluices licensed by two disjoined clauses:
</p>
<ol style="counter-reset: item 0"><li>Either the torsion axle is broken or the spring hangers are jammed up, but which is hard to say.</li>
<li>That they either migrate from, or hibernate in this country, is certain, but which of the two still divides opinion.</li>

  <li>Cold/wind, and not a nice day but they are calling for rain OR snow they don't know which.</li></ol>

<p>Consider also a sluice on an indefinite locative adverbial:</p>

<ol style="counter-reset: item 3"><li>Somewhere between Little Rock and Minneapolis will get a good amount of rain or snow. They don't know where yet.</li></ol>

<p>Does this present a problem for the licensing condition proposed by Barros and Kotek (2019) (Ellipsis licensing and redundancy reduction: A focus-based approach) ((8), =(57))?</p>
