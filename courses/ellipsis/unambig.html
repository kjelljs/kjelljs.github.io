title: "The strict/sloppy ambiguity"
---
<div class="ingress"><p>Sentence (1) is ambiguous. On one reading, Molly's mother is proud of the bass Molly caught, on the other, she is proud of the bass she herself caught. The former is the strict reading, the latter is the sloppy reading.</p>
<p>Molly is proud of the bass she caught, and so is her mother / and her mother is, too.</p>
<p>Standardly, the source of the ambiguity is placed in the antecedent, the first, ellipsis-less clause.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Ambiguous antecedent</h3>
<p>The standard approach to referentially ambiguous VP ellipsis builds on the assumption that the antecedent is ambiguous while the 'copy' is not â€“ in the typical case, that the relevant anaphor or pronoun is bound either directly by the referential subject or by the VP abstractor. One exponent of this approach can be found in
Liz Coppock and Lucas Champollion: <i>Invitation to Formal Semantics</i> (draft of Aug 21, 2020), esp. pp. 290ff.
