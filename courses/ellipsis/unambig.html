title: "The strict/sloppy ambiguity"
---
<div class="ingress"><p>Sentence (1) is ambiguous. On one reading, Molly's mother is proud of the bass Molly caught, on the other, she is proud of the bass she herself caught. The former is the strict reading, the latter is the sloppy reading.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;Molly is proud of the bass she caught, and so is her mother.</p>
<p>Standardly, the source of the ambiguity is placed in the antecedent, the first, ellipsis-less clause.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Ambiguous antecedent</h3>
<p>The standard approach to ambiguous VP ellipsis assumes that the antecedent is ambiguous while the 'copy' is not â€“ more exactly, that a pronoun (like <i>she</i> in (1)) or an anaphor (like <i>her</i> in (2)) can be bound in two ways: directly by the subject or by the VP abstractor.</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;Molly stretched her leg and Dolly did too.</p>
<p>(To get the strict reading, imagine that the leg was cramped and Dolly is a physiotherapist.)</p><p>One exponent of this approach can be found in
