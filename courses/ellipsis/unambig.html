title: "The strict/sloppy ambiguity"
---
<div class="ingress"><p>Sentence (1) is ambiguous. On one reading, Molly's mother is proud of the bass Molly caught, on the other, she is proud of the bass she herself caught. The former is the strict reading, the latter is the sloppy reading.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;Molly is proud of the bass she caught, and so is her mother.</p>
<p>Standardly, the source of the ambiguity is placed in the antecedent, the first, ellipsis-less clause.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Ambiguous antecedent</h3>
<div style="float:right;"><figure class="rightfig"><img style="height:300px; border: 2px solid #666" src="/pics/sloppy.jpg"></figure></div><p>The standard approach to ambiguous VP ellipsis assumes that the antecedent is ambiguous while the 'copy' is not – more exactly, that a pronoun (like <i>she</i> in (1)) or an anaphor (like <i>her</i> in (2)) can be bound in two ways: directly by the subject or by the VP abstractor.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;Molly stretched her leg and Dolly did too.</p>
<p>(To get the strict reading, imagine that the leg was cramped and Dolly is a physiotherapist.) Sloppily, the antecedent VP is either to stretch Molly's leg (strict) or to stretch one's leg (sloppy).</p><p>One exponent of this approach can be found in
Liz Coppock and Lucas Champollion: <i>Invitation to Formal Semantics</i> (draft of Aug 21, 2020), esp. pp. 290ff.

<h3>Unambiguous antecedent</h3>
<p>One way of deriving the two readings without assuming an ambiguity in the antecedent VP or that the ellipsis is an expression built but not pronounced is to follow Rooth (1992a) (A theory of focus interpretation) and (1992b) (Ellipsis redundancy and reduction redundancy):</p> <p>The antecedent VP may be to stretch Molly's leg or it may be to stretch one's leg – that doesn't matter; what matters is that there are two ways to resolve the <b>focus presupposition</b> of [<i>Dolly</i>]<sub>F</sub> <i>did</i>, namely, to</p> <p>– the proposition that an alternative to Dolly has the property of stretching one's leg or</p>
<p>- the proposition that an alternative to Dolly has the property of stretching Molly's leg.</p>
<p>Then what Dolly is understood as doing, echoing the two ways to resolve the focus presupposition, is either stretching one's, that is, her own, leg, or it is stretching Molly's leg
