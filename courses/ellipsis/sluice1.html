<style>
  ol {
  margin-left: 0;
  padding-left: 0;
}
ol li {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: .5em;
  margin-left: 2em;
}

  width: 2em;
  margin-left: -2em;

</style>

<div class="ingress"><p>Sluices on indefinites or disjunctions may seem to require wide scope for those – but then again, there is a confound…</p></div>
<p>The following examples may seem slightly odd:</p>
<ol style="counter-reset: item 0"><li>We have to find someone who knows Arabic but we haven't been told who yet.</li>
  <li>Somebody always complains about the sound quality. You'll know who soon enough.
</li>
<li>You may have a beer or a glass of wine with the evening meal. I don't remember which though.</li>
</ol>
<p>How is that?</p> 
<p>Now the following example may seem to break ranks with (1)–(3) in allowing two readings:</p>
<ol style="counter-reset: item 3"><li>Everybody ordered a starter, but the waitress forgot what.</li></ol>
<p>Do you agree? How could the "new" reading be characterized? (Keyword: 'pair-list')</p>
