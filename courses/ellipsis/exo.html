<div class="ingress"><p>Empty nouns (ENs) and NP ellipsis (NPE) have different resolution conditions, and maybe different depths.</p></div>
<h3>EN vs. NPE in (say) German</h3>
<p>
  (1) and (2) differ in the requirements they place on contexts they could be used in.</p> 
<ol><li>Geben Sie mir das Teuerste, was Sie haben.</li>
  <li>Geben Sie mir den teuersten, den Sie haben.</li>
</ol>
<p>How?</p>
<p>
The pair would not work in English. It would in Norwegian (Jeg skal få det/den dyreste dere har), but the German one features two extra differences, over and above gender…</p>

<h3>Deep and surface, endophoric and exophoric</h3>
<p>Saab (2019) subsumes NPE (NP-ellipsis) under 'surface anaphora' and ENs (empty noun constructions) under ‘deep anaphora’. (40a), rendered here as (3), is a typical instance of the latter:</p>

(1)  een blinde // a blind // ‘a blind person’ 

(57a), rendered below as (2), is also argued to be an instance of the latter – because the anaphora resolution is ‘exophoric’ (see, for example, Ginzburg 2013, pdf in this module):

(2)  [pointing to a red skirt; pollera is feminine in Spanish] 
(1)  Dame la roja. \\  give.IMP.2SG:CL.1SG  DET:F[SG]  red:F[SG]  \\  ‘Give me the red one.’

Now isn't that problematic? Could there be other ways to look at it?
