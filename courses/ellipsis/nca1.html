<div class="ingress"><p>The article on Null Complement Anaphora in <i>The Oxford Handbook of Ellipsis</i> misrepresents one theory of it.</p></div>



<p>According to Saeboe (1996) (Anaphoric presuppositions and zero anaphora), most or all cases of Null Complement Anaphora are anaphoric because the null complement is involved in a presupposition independently triggered by the predicate.</p>

<p>The summary of this proposal given by Depiante (2018) (Null Complement Anaphora, in The Oxford Handbook of Ellipsis) is arguably more or less misleading. Substitute another way of reviewing it in the framework of the Depiante article, feeling free to move the review to another section or to spread it out.</p>
