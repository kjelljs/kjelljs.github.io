</div class="ingress"><p>Strict readings are commonly held to be unavailable when the source clause subject is a quantifier, as in (1). 
</p></div>
<p>(1) &nbsp;Everyone stretched their muscles and the physiotherapist did too.</p>
<p>On the other hand, (2) does display a strict reading:</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;Everyone stretched their muscles after the physiotherapist did.</p>
<p>
How could this be explained?
