<div class="ingress"><p>Sluices where the <i>wh-</i> phrase is followed by <i>else</i> are different. Maybe more different on some theoriesâ€¦</p></div>
<p>Barros and Kotek (2019) (Ellipsis licensing and redundancy reduction: A focus-based approach) do not consider wh- else sluices, like:</p>
<ol style="counter-reset: item 0"><li>I'm already prepared to play Chopin nocturne op 9 no 2 but don't know what else.<Ili></ol>
<p>How would this case fit into their picture of focus-based licensing, where the union over the focus semantic value of the sluice clause has to equal the union over the focus semantic value of the antecedent?</p>
