}
ol li {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: .5em;
  margin-left: 2em;

<div class="ingress"><p>If "and…too" stripping constructions are all about reduced or elided conjunctions, why construct them at all –</p></div>

<p>why not, informally, conjoin for instance DPs and instead of (1) or (2) (from the Wikipedia page on stripping) say or write (3) or (4)?</p>

<ol style="counter-reset: item 0; margin-top:-10px">
  
<li>Susan works at night, and Bill too.</li>
<li>She asked the kids to stay, and the adults too.</li>

<li>Susan and Bill work at night.</li>
<li>She asked the kids and the adults to stay.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider these attested examples:</p>

<ol style="counter-reset: item 4; margin-top:-10px">
  
<li>I learn to be Mexican from Toni, Andrea’s mom. And others, too. Aunt Mati, from Mexico City, and Uncle Eddie, who went there to find her. Annetta, who became a world-class baton twirler. And my mom, too, but I don’t think she knows it.</li>
<li>Who most encouraged you as a basketball player?</br>
Lopez: Probably my older brothers. I’d definitely say them. And my mom, too, just because she had it a lot worse being a swimmer and having to wake up early, swim before school and then swim after school, just miles a day.</li>

<li>Your mom was always taking care of me {and my mom too}.</li>
</ol>
